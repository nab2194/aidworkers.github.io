In conjunction with U.S. occupation of Afghanistan, the statistics associated with this country merit a closer look: focusing on the years 2008 to 2016 in which the greatest number of attacks occurred.</p>

<p>Contextual Factors</p>
<p><em>2012</em> - The significant drop in aid worker death coincides with the withdrawal of half of American troops in Afghanistan.</p>
<p><em>2013</em> - A sharp increase in aid worker deaths, primarily in rural areas. In 2013, aid workers were frequently caught in crossfire, ambush, and accidents, especially as <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-worlds-most-dangerous-place-aid-workers">tensions</a> between government and insurgent groups rose sharply. As you can see in this figure, a majority of aid workers killed are of national origin. According to a report published by the <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sc11524.doc.htm">UN in 2013</a>, “Afghan aid workers suffered heavy casualties in part because international organizations were using local staff and local organizations to reduce their own risk…About 85 per cent of United Nations staff involved in security incidents were Afghans; for international non-governmental organizations, it was 76 per cent.” It is important to note here that national aid workers are more frequently engaged in front line work than their international counterparts, especially in extremely dangerous operations. “Security arrangements of those organizations and the United Nations often left local humanitarian organizations <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sc11524.doc.htm">less secure</a>”. National aid workers, often acting for international aid organizations, rarely received the same security protections as their international colleagues, forcing them into increasingly unsafe situations.</p>
<p>After noting this sharp increase in attacks against local aid workers, many aid organizations took steps to decrease apparent distinctions between international and national aid workers in an effort to protect national aid workers’ security.</p>

<h2>Attack Types</h2>
<p>Aid workers are uniquely vulnerable to attacks given the dangerous settings in which they work. While aid workers are somewhat protected by International Humanitarian Law and the organizations they work with, this does not guarantee safety, especially in conflict-heavy contexts.</p>

<p>Of known attack types affecting aid workers in Afghanistan, the most common are kidnappings, shootings, ambushes, and raids. The largest attack was a 2015 aerial bombardment by the U.S. military, in which aid workers were caught in combat/crossfire that left <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-attack-hospital-patients/bombed-afghan-hospital-staff-helpless-as-patients-burned-in-wards-idUSKCN0RX0TP20151003">19 dead and 37 wounded</a> (including patients and aid workers).</p>
<p>On October 3rd, 2015, following Taliban insurgents storming the capital, the U.S. military conducted a 4-hour airstrike that repeatedly and precisely hit a trauma hospital run by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, Doctors Without Borders), destroying the main hospital building. Patients unable to escape <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-attack-hospital-patients/bombed-afghan-hospital-staff-helpless-as-patients-burned-in-wards-idUSKCN0RX0TP20151003">burned to death</a>, while hospital staff scrambled to evacuate as many patients as possible. Since its opening in 2011, the MSF Kunduz hospital had become an important <a href="https://www.msf.org/kunduz-hospital-attack-depth">lifeline</a> for thousands. On the night of the attack, 105 patients and 140 MSF staff were present in the hospital.</p>
<p>The military initially justified the attack by claiming reports of Taliban militia on-site. MSF reported the hospital was clearly marked with updated GPS coordinates provided to American and Coalition forces as recently as one week before the attack. Furthermore, bombing continued for 30 minutes after MSF urgently communicated to military leadership that a hospital was being hit. Eventually, the U.S. stated that the airstrike was accidental. MSF has repeatedly called for an independent investigation of possible war crimes, which has not occurred.</p>

<p>Aid workers are most vulnerable when traveling on the road. In many of these incidents, aid workers are collateral damage, caught in the crossfire between government vehicles (Afghan National Army and International Security Assistance Force) and insurgent groups. After the International Security Assistance Force withdrew in 2011, road ambushes and attacks <a href="https://aidworkersecurity.org/sites/default/files/2020-08/Aid%20Worker%20Security%20Report%202014.pdf">increased substantially</a>.</p>
<p>Roads are extremely difficult to protect. Attacks and ambush can come in the form of illegitimate checkpoints, road blocks, and geographically poorly protected areas (bends in the road, choke points). Drive-by shootings, carjacking, and IEDs (landmines) also represent major challenges to road travel. IEDs do not involve significant planning and are difficult to predict and avoid, making them <a href="https://aidworkersecurity.org/sites/default/files/2020-08/Aid%20Worker%20Security%20Report%202014.pdf">especially common and particularly dangerous</a>, as you can see in the figure above.</p>
